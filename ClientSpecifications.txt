Vision Statement

The Study Tracker Program (STP) is a terminal-based Java application designed to enhance the learning experience
by quizzing users on subject material from a CSV file of questions and answers. The program aims to facilitate
progressive learning through repeated practice, tracking performance, and encouraging mastery by storing quiz
results with timestamps. By consistently using STP, users will progressively improve their knowledge, with the
ultimate goal of achieving 100% accuracy on their exams.
